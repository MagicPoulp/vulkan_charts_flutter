  # This section identifies your Flutter project as a module meant for
  # embedding in a native host app.  These identifiers should _not_ ordinarily
  # be changed after generation - they are used to ensure that the tooling can
  # maintain consistency when adding or modifying assets and plugins.
  # They also do not have any bearing on your native host application's
  # identifiers, which may be completely independent or the same as these.
